<h1>SuperMario API</h1>
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,Express, Node.js




## Optimizations

While I improve this project, I hope to added additional characters and even store pictures of the characters themselves. As the database grows, I'll also like to used a cloud service to store my data.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned that I enjoy backend stuff. It was a great learning experience to further explore how API's work under the hood.
